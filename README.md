**PISS (Picture Secret Steganography)** is a command line tool to encode/decode secrets into/from image files using LSB steganography.

Run `piss --help` for usage.

## Installation
```sh
cargo install piss
```

## Usage examples
### Encode a secret into an image
```sh
piss encode samples/the-matrix.jpg samples/secret.txt samples/the-matrix-reloaded.png
```

Original image:

![alt text](https://github.com/c0dearm/piss/raw/master/samples/the-matrix.jpg "Original image")

Image with secret:

![alt text](https://github.com/c0dearm/piss/raw/master/samples/the-matrix-reloaded.png "Image with secret")

### Recover secret from image:
```sh
piss decode samples/the-matrix-reloaded.png samples/secret-reloaded.txt
```

### Miscelaneous
By default, PISS uses 2 bits per image byte to encode the secret, you can change this value if desired:
```sh
piss -b 4 encode samples/the-matrix.jpg samples/secret.txt samples/the-matrix-reloaded.png
```

Just remember to decode using the same number of bits, otherwise the output will be garbage:
```sh
piss -b 4 decode samples/the-matrix-reloaded.png samples/secret-reloaded.txt
```

## Important note
It is not recommended to encode secrets and save the output as `.jpg` as compression is performed and the secret is lost.

## Features

### Supports from 1 to 8 bits secret encoding
The user can specify the number of bits of the secret to use per image byte

### Change between image formats
It is possible to convert the image format during encoding, just set a different extension for the output.
